# Linux Basics: Boot, FHS and Concepts

Source: CompTIA Linux+ XK0-006, objective 1.1


## Basic boot process

1. The workstation firmware starts, performing a quick check of the hardware (called a Power-On Self-Test, or POST) and then looks for a bootloader program to run from a bootable device.
2. The bootloader runs and determines what Linux kernel to load.
3. The kernel program loads into memory and starts the necessary background programs required for the system to operate.

## Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), is the standard format defined for the Linux virtual directory. It defines core folder names and locations that should be present on every Linux system and what type of data they should contain.

Common Linux FHS folders
|Folder|Description|
|---|---|
|/bin|Executable programs necessary for the system to run in single-user mode|
|/boot|Contains bootloader files used to boot the system|
|/dev|Device files|
|/etc|System service configuration files|
|/home|Contains user data files|
|/lib|Library files required by executable programs|
|/media|Used as a mount point for removable devices|
|/mnt|Also used as a mount point for removable devices|
|/opt|Contains data for optional third-party programs|
|/proc|Virtual filesystem providing kernel and process information as files, updated in real time|
|/root|The home directory for the root user account|
|/sbin|Executable programs required by the system|
|/sys|Virtual filesystem providing device, driver, and some kernel information as files, updated in real time.|
|/tmp|Contains temporary files created by system users|
|/usr|Contains data for standard Linux programs|
|/usr/bin|Contains local user programs and data|
|/usr/local|Contains data for programs unique to the local installation|
|/usr/sbin|Contains data for system programs and data|
|/var|Files whose content is expected to change frequently, such as log iles|

## Server architectures

* Intel/AMD x86 and x86_64: Intel 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs used in most desktop and laptop computers.
* AMD64: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 64-bit CPUs
* IBM Z (S390X): IBM series of mainframes and minicomputers
* RISC-V: The Reduced Instruction Set Computing, version 5 open standard architecture that can be used by any CPU manufacturer

## Distributions
* RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
* Ubuntu
* openSUSE

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

A GUI is a series of components that work together to provide the graphical setting for the user interface. It is typically broken up into the following graphical sections and functions:
* Desktop Settings
* Display Manager
* File Manager
* Icons
* Favorites Bar
* Launch
* Menus
* Panels
* System Tray
* Widgets
* Window Manager

## Software licensing

* **Copyleft Licenses**: Allow you to download and use the softwaresource code, but restrictions apply on how you can use or distribute it. Any changes you make to the code inherit the license terms of the parent software.
    * **GNU General Public License (GPL)**: Allows you to make changes to the source code, but you must release your changes to the public under the GPL license.
    * **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)**: Allows you to integrate the source code (or even just parts of it) into your own project without having to release it to the public
* **Permissive Licenses**: Allow you to download and use the source code, but don't place any restrictions on the redistribution of it. 
    * **Apache License**: Allows you to create derivative software that uses a different license model.
    * **MIT License**: Allows you to do anything you want with the source code, as long as the original copyright notice is included with all derivative work.
